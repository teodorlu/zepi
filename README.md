# Zepi

## Motivation

If we don't know the past, we'll repeat it. If we don't know our foundations, we'll remake them.

So, let's make a little language and see how that feels.

## Q: I want a Python lisp, what should I look at?

## Q: Why should I care about Zepi?

Because it's small enough to read from start to finish.

## How to use Zepi

    python zepi.py repl

## How to develop Zepi

    ./repl

This puts you into a special zepi REPL that can also reload the zepi interpreter.
To reload the zepi interpreter, use the `!zreload` magic command:

    > !zreload
